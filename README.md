# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor
This Project is an implementation to a 32-bit singlecycle micro architecture RISC-V processor based on 
Harvard Architecture. The single-cycle 
microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one 
cycle. In other words, instruction fetch, instruction 
decode, execute, write back, and program counter
update occurs within a single clock cycle
